A PCA can help simplify the findings of a model by limiting the outside \"noise\" on the variable of interest and creating clusters to see how the binary outcomes can be predicted. In this case, there is a small cluster of lower income cases that can be seen as separate and can be used as an identifying indicator, however the bulk of the data is clumped together closely. While one side of the clump appears higher income and the other lower income, this indicates that it is difficult to determine factors that clearly indicate income status. "
