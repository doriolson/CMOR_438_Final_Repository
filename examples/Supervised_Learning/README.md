Supervised learning refers to machine learning tasks where each example comes with an associated label or target value. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs (features) to outputs (labels) so that the model can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

This directory contains examples of common supervised learning algorithms for both regression and classification, such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, ensemble methods, and neural networks.

The supervised learning algorithms use the adult income dataset. This dataset contains 48842 observations of 15 variables. More information can be found in the data folder. The variables in the data are: 
 - age
 - workclass: what type of employment (private, government, self-employed, etc)
 - fnlwgt: final weight, a scaling factor to know how much weight that observation (or person's data) carries
 - education: what was your highest degree or level of education
 - educational-num: numerical representation of education in years
 - marital-status
 - occupation
 - relationship: what role are you in your household (own-child, husband, unmarried, etc)
 - race
 - gender
 - capital-gain
 - capital-loss
 - hours-per-week: the number of hours you work in a week
 - native-country
 - income: whether your income is above or below/including $50,000
