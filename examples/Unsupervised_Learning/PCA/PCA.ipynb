The graph shows that 80% of variance is explained within the first 5 variables, indicating there is a lot of overlap within the variables and there is definitely room for the model to simplify some of these variables into fewer components. We can certainly reduce the number of components given the results of this graph, and thus the next steps will look at just two components."
