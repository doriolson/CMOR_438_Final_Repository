## Examples Folder

This is the examples folder, which contains the detailed descriptions and notebooks for all of our machine learning algorithms. The folder is divided into two sections, supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

The supervised machine learning algorithms included in this folder are:
 - Decision Trees
 - Ensemble Methods
 - K Nearst Neighbors
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression
 - Multilayer Perceptron
 - Perceptron
 - Regression Trees

 The unsupervised machine learning algorthms included in this folder are: 
 - Community Detection
 - DBSCAN
 - K Means Clustering
 - Principal Component Analysis


The purpose of the examples folder is to provide a clean, efficient, and easily understandable description of our machine learning algorithms. The code within this folder calls functions that have been created in the src folder and also codes within the documents themselves to produce clear visual interpretations and analyses of the machine learning algorithms. Ttese files describe how these algorithms work with the assistance of functions, tables, evaluations, and visualizations that aid the reader in understanding the importance of the models.
