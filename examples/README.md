## Examples Folder


This is the examples folder, which contains the detailed descriptions and notebooks for all of our machine learning algorithms. The folder is divided into two sections, supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

The supervised machine learning algorithms included in this folder are:
 - Decision Trees
 - Ensemble Methods
 - K Nearst Neighbors
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression
 - Multilayer Perceptron
 - Perceptron
 - Regression Trees

 The unsupervised machine learning algorthms included in this folder are: 
 - Community Detection
 - DBSCAN
 - K Means Clustering
 - Principal Component Analysis
