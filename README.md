## CMOR 438: Data Science & Machine Learning

### Course Description
This repository contains the final project for **CMOR 438** at Rice University. The project showcases a cohesive body of work combining a custom-built Python machine learning package, `rice_ml`, with Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate fundamental and advanced machine learning concepts.

**Authors:** Ruchi Tiwari & Dori Olson  
**Instructor:** Dr. Randy R. Davila

### Repository Overview
The repository is organized into three main components:

- **`src/rice_ml/`**: A custom Python package containing from-scratch implementations of ML algorithms.  
- **`examples/`**: Detailed Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application of each model.  
- **`data/`**: Datasets utilized for model training and evaluation.

### Models Covered

The following algorithms have been implemented in our custom library and documented in the example notebooks:

#### Supervised Learning
- **Linear & Logistic Regression**: Foundations of predictive modeling and classification.  
- **Perceptron & Multilayer Perceptron**: Neural network architectures using gradient descent.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Instance-based learning using custom distance metrics.  
- **Decision & Regression Trees**: Non-linear models for classification and regression.  
- **Ensemble Methods**: Advanced techniques including Random Forests and bagging.  

#### Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering**: Centroid-based partitioning of data.  
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based spatial clustering for discovering clusters of arbitrary shape.  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.  
- **Community Detection**: Identifying structured groups within network data.
