## The Source Code for Rice ML

This folder contains the source code for all of our algorithms within the repository. We use the src primarily as a location to store the code for all of the functions which we will call in our example folders. Doign this ensures that the example code is as clean and efficient as possible. 

The src folder also contains our processing functions separate from the algorithms themselves, in the processing folder. Thus, the src is divided into processing, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. The files within each are in essence a directory of the functions needed to perform each machine learning algorithm. 

Additionally, the src folder serves as a place for us to work through the code and draft the code for various other folders.
